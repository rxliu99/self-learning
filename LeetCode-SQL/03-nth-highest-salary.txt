Nth Highest Salary

https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/
Q3 in list

Takeaways:
	- the coorperation between LIMIT and OFFSET
	- LIMIT only accepts INTEGER values
	- DISTINCT considers NULL to be a unique value in SQL, so the query returns NULL if there is no nth highest salary
	
Solution:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M = N-1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT(salary)
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY salary DESC
      LIMIT 1
      OFFSET M
  );
END
