Rising Temperature

Q12 in list

Takeaways:
	- use DATEDIFF(date1, date2) to calculate the difference between dates; diff = date1 - date2; diff > 0 if date1 > date2
	- DATEDIFF() will also work with datetime values, and only the dates will be compared
	- alternative: TO_DAYS(date1)-TO_DAYS(date2); TO_DAYS(date) calculates the number of days between date and year 0; diff > 0 if date1 > date2
	- alternative2: DATE_SUB(date1, INTERVAL n DAY) substracts n days from date1; the keyword for INTERVAL ranges from MICROSECOND to YEAR

Solution:
SELECT t1.id
FROM Weather t1
JOIN Weather t2
ON DATEDIFF(t1.recordDate, t2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE t1.temperature > t2.temperature;
