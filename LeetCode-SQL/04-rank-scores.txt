Rank Scores

https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/
Q4 in list

Takeaways:
	- the usage of DENSE_RANK()
	- DENSE_RANK() uses the next chronological ranking value, but RANK() skips the next available ranking value(s)
	- when the rows are ordered in a specific way for DENSE_RANK, no need for a ORDER BY unless wishing to change the ordering
	- when the name of column is reserved for something else (e.g. a function), use quotation marks to avoid error
	
Solution:
SELECT score,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) "rank"
FROM Scores;

Alternative solution:
# without using DENSE_RANK()
# for each score in S, count how many scores in S2 is greater than or equal to that score; larger scores have lower counts
SELECT S.Score, 
       COUNT(S2.Score) AS "rank" 
FROM Scores S
JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Scores) S2
ON S.Score <= S2.Score
GROUP BY S.Id 
ORDER BY S.Score DESC;
