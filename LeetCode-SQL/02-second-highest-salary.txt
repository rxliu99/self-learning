Second Highest Salary

https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/
Q2 in list

Takeaways:
	- the inner query returns an empty result set, instead of NULL
	- to get the NULL result, the empty result set needs to be mapped into a SELECT statement
	- use DISTINCT to make sure that the correct second highest is picked up when there are repetations,
		such as (200, 200, 100)

Solution:
# useful for finding nth highest for n > 1
# just change the OFFSET statement
SELECT 
(
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) as SecondHighestSalary;

Alternative solution:
# only useful for finding 2nd highest
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
