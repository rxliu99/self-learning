Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/
Q6 in list

Takeaways:
	- for INNER JOIN (or simply JOIN), there is no difference between having the conditions in ON clause verses having them in WHERE clause
	- for LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, there might be a difference in result and/or run speed
	
Solution:
SELECT t1.name AS "Employee"
FROM Employee t1
JOIN Employee t2
ON t1.managerId = t2.id AND t1.salary > t2.salary;

Alternative solution:
# just having a WHERE clause instead of using two conditions for ON
SELECT t1.name AS "Employee"
FROM Employee t1
JOIN Employee t2
ON t1.managerId = t2.id
WHERE t1.salary > t2.salary;
