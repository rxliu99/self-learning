Consecutive Numbers

https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/
Q5 in list

Takeaways:
	- the usage of self join
	- JOIN with an ON clause that is more complex than the basic t1.id = t2.id
	- the coorperation of IN and subquery
	
Solution:
# use self joins
# the most intuitive for me, but not helpful if the question asks for numbers that appear at least 4 or more times consecutively
SELECT DISTINCT(t1.num) AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs t1
JOIN Logs t2
ON t2.id = t1.id + 1
JOIN Logs t3
ON t3.id = t1.id + 2
WHERE t1.num = t2.num AND t2.num = t3.num;

Alternative solution:
# use subqueries
# useful when the question wants numbers that appear more times consecutively
# also useful when comparing nonconsecutive rows (e.g. finding numbers that appear 3 times with 1 row in between)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs
WHERE (id + 1, num) IN (SELECT * FROM Logs) AND 
      (id + 2, num) IN (SELECT * FROM Logs);
