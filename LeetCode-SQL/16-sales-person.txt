Sales Person

https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/
Q16 in list

Takeaways:
	- use subquery to create a list for filtering
	- joining more than two tables together

Solution:
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN 
(   
    # the list of sales_id who had orders related to "RED"
    SELECT sales_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE com_id IN 
    (   
        # the com_id whose name is "RED"
        SELECT com_id 
        FROM Company 
        WHERE name = "RED"
    )
);

Alternative solution:
# essentially the same logic, but looks cleaner since there's only one subquery
# not any faster than the previous solution
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN
    (SELECT s.sales_id sales_id
     FROM SalesPerson s
     LEFT JOIN Orders o
     ON o.sales_id = s.sales_id
     LEFT JOIN Company c
     ON o.com_id = c.com_id
     WHERE c.name = 'RED');
