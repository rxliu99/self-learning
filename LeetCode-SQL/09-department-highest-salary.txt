Solution:
WITH cte AS
(
    SELECT d.name AS "Department",
           e.name AS "Employee",
           e.salary AS Salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId 
                              ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS ranking
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d
    ON e.departmentId = d.id
)

SELECT Department,
       Employee,
       Salary
FROM cte
WHERE ranking = 1;

Alternative solution:
# a different window function
WITH cte AS
(
    SELECT name,
           salary,
           departmentId,
           MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId) AS max_salary
    FROM Employee e
)

SELECT d.name AS Department,
       cte.name AS Employee,
       cte.salary
FROM cte
JOIN Department d
ON cte.departmentId = d.id
WHERE cte.salary = cte.max_salary;
