Classes More Than 5 Students

https://leetcode.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/
Q15 in list

Takeaways:
	- need to use HAVING, instead of WHERE, when the condition involves an aggregation function
	- always alias sub tables

Solution:
SELECT class
FROM
    (SELECT class, 
            COUNT(DISTINCT student) AS num
    FROM courses
    GROUP BY class) AS counter
WHERE num >= 5;

Alternative solution:
# no subquery but significantly slower than the previous solution
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;
