Q10 in list

Takeaways:
	- use DENSE_RANK() to select top n
	- use subquery to calculate a boundary, which can be used to filter rows; note how CTE cannot be used in this situation

Solution:
WITH cte AS
(
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId
                          ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM Employee
)

SELECT d.name AS Department,
       cte.name AS Employee,
       cte.salary
FROM cte
JOIN Department d
ON cte.departmentId = d.id
WHERE salary_rank < 4;

Alternative solution:
# For the top earners, no more than 3 salary is bigger than each of their salary in the company 
SELECT d.name AS 'Department', 
       e.name AS 'Employee',
       e.salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d 
ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE 3 > 
         (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.salary)
          FROM Employee e1
          WHERE e1.salary > e.salary AND 
	        e1.departmentId = e.departmentId);
