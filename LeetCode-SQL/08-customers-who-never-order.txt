Takeaways:
	- the difference between (INNER) JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN
		- (INNER) JOIN: returns only rows that satisfy the given condition(s) from both tables
		- LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from left table, even if no matching rows have been found in the right table;
		             where no matches have been found, NULL is returned
		- RIGHT JOIN: returns all rows from right table, even if no matching rows have been found in the left table;
		             where no matches have been found, NULL is returned
	- for LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, the rows don't have a match will be filled partially with NULL

Solution:
SELECT c.name Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE customerId IS NULL;
